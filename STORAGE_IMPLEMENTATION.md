  - Download functionality for all file types
  - Grading with timestamp tracking

### 5. Database Schema Updates
- **New Columns Added:**
  - `submissions.file_path` - Storage path for cleanup
  - `submissions.graded_at` - Timestamp when graded
  - `user_profiles.phone_number` - Optional phone number
  - `user_profiles.bio` - Optional biography
- **Enhanced Type Definitions:**
  - Updated interfaces to include new fields
  - Proper TypeScript types for all storage functions

### 6. Security & Permissions
- **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:**
  - Users can only upload/modify their own profile images
  - Students can upload task submissions
  - Admins can view all task submissions
  - Secure file path generation

## 🗂️ Storage Structure

```
Supabase Storage/
├── profile-images/ (Public Bucket)
│   └── users/
│       └── {userId}/
│           └── profile.{ext}
└── task-submissions/ (Private Bucket)
    └── submissions/
        └── {taskId}/
            └── {userId}_{taskId}_{timestamp}.{ext}
```

## 🚀 How to Use

   - Upload profile picture, add bio and phone number
   - Save changes

2. **Submit Assignments:**
   - Go to any course with assignments
   - Select a topic with a task
   - Upload your assignment file
   - View submission status and grades

### For Admins:

   - Add points and feedback
   - Submit grade

## 🛠️ Setup Required

1. **Run Database Migration:**
   ```sql
   -- See: database/migrations/add_storage_support.sql
   ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN file_path VARCHAR(500);
   ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(20);
   ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN bio TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE submissions ADD COLUMN graded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
   ```

2. **Create Storage Buckets in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - `profile-images` (Public)
   - `task-submissions` (Private)

3. **Set Up Storage Policies:**
   - See full policies in `DATABASE_MIGRATION.md`

## 🔧 Technical Features

- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and user feedback
- **Progress Indicators:** Real-time upload progress
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Handles file replacement and deletion
- **Secure URLs:** Proper file access control
